/* read_inode: Fills an inode data structure with the data from one
   inode in disk. Determines the block group number and index within
   the group from the inode number, then reads the inode from the
   inode table in the corresponding group. Saves the inode data in
   buffer 'buffer'.
   
   Parameters:
     volume: pointer to volume.
     inode_no: Number of the inode to read from disk.
     buffer: Pointer to location where data is to be stored.

   Returns:
     In case of success, returns a positive value. In case of error,
     returns -1.

/* read_inode_block_no: Returns the block number containing the data
   associated to a particular index. For indices 0-11, returns the
   direct block number; for larger indices, returns the block number
   at the corresponding indirect block.
   
   Parameters:
     volume: Pointer to volume.
     inode: Pointer to inode structure where data is to be sourced.
     index: Index to the block number to be searched.

   Returns:
     In case of success, returns the block number to be used for the
     corresponding entry. This block number may be 0 (zero) in case of
     sparse files. In case of error, returns
     EXT2_INVALID_BLOCK_NUMBER.

/* read_file_block: Returns the content of a specific file, limited to

   Parameters:
     volume: Pointer to volume.
     inode: Pointer to inode structure for the file.
     offset: Offset, in bytes from the start of the file, of the data
             to be read.
     max_size: Maximum number of bytes to read from the block.

/* read_file_content: Returns the content of a specific file, limited
